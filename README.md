Teacher Evaluation Rubric
=========================

An evaluation rubric is a self-assessment tool helping you see and describe your knowledge, skills, and abilities. Firstly, it helps you perceive and name all the fundamental parts of a concept (e.g., being able to program means being able to design an algorithm, work with memory effectively, know the syntax, . . . ). Secondly, it enables you to evaluate your competence in these parts (e.g., I’m able to design a working algorithm, though I find it problematic to express it in code and I don’t optimize memory usage at all).
